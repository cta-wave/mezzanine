# Synchronisation timing video test sequence generator

The scripts in this directory are modified versions of the video test sequence generator scripts from [DVB companion screen synchronisation timing accuracy measurement](https://www.github.com/BBC/dvbcss-synctiming), transformed to Python 3 code using [2to3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html).

The scripts in this directory are used to generate a still image sequence and corresponding WAV file that can be converted into a video file containing a sequence of aligned and carefully timed "beeps" and "flashes".

This is used for checking alignment between audio and video.
