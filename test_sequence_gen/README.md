# Synchronisation timing video test sequence generator

The  scripts in this directory originate from [DVB companion screen synchronisation
timing accuracy measurement](https://www.github.com/BBC/dvbcss-synctiming)

The scripts in this directory will generate a still image sequence and
corresponding WAV file that can be converted into a video file containing a
sequence of aligned and carefully timed "beeps" and "flashes".

This can be used for checking alignment between audio and video.
