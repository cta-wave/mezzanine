Code for generating timings for sequences of events (such as flashes or beeps),
starting with generation 

Includes:

* a maximal-length-sequence bit stream generator to create unique patterns of bits

* a sequence encoder that transforms a bit stream into a set of timings of events
  where 0 and 1 are encoded with different patterns of events
  
* a means of transforming the times of events into start and end times for
  events if they all have a particular duration (e.g. the sample number at which
  a beep begins and ends, or the frame numbers containing the white pixels for
  a flash
  
* a means to generate a stream of values corresponding to audio samples or frames
